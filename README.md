CIFAR-10 IMAGE CLASSIFIER USING DEEP LEARNING AND FLASK

## PROJECT OVERVIEW

This project demonstrates an end-to-end image classification pipeline using the CIFAR-10 dataset and a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The trained model is deployed via a Flask-based web application, allowing users to upload and classify images through a browser interface. The application predicts the object category of the uploaded image, identifying it as one of the 10 classes defined in the CIFAR-10 dataset.

## OBJECTIVE

The goal of this project is to accurately classify color images from the CIFAR-10 dataset into 10 categories using a deep learning model and to make this model accessible to users through a simple, interactive web application. The project emphasizes both model development and real-world deployment.

## ABOUT THE CIFAR-10 DATASET

The CIFAR-10 dataset is a standard benchmark dataset in computer vision. It contains 60,000 32x32 color images, divided into 10 classes:

1. Airplane
2. Automobile
3. Bird
4. Cat
5. Deer
6. Dog
7. Frog
8. Horse
9. Ship
10. Truck

The dataset is split into 50,000 training images and 10,000 test images. Each image belongs to one of the classes and is labeled accordingly.

## MODEL ARCHITECTURE

The model used is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), designed to handle image classification tasks. The architecture typically includes:

* Convolutional layers to extract spatial features
* ReLU activation functions for non-linearity
* MaxPooling layers to reduce dimensionality
* Dropout layers to mitigate overfitting
* Fully connected (Dense) layers to compute final predictions
* A Softmax output layer to produce class probabilities

The model is trained using the Adam optimizer and categorical crossentropy loss function, and its performance is evaluated using accuracy as the primary metric.


## PROJECT STRUCTURE

The project directory is organized as follows:


* model/: Contains the trained Keras model file (e.g., cifar\_model.h5)
* image\_classification.ipynb: Notebook for training the CNN model
* requirements.txt: Python package dependencies
* README.md: Project documentation

## HOW TO USE

1. Clone the repository and navigate into the project directory.
2. (Optional) Train the model using the Jupyter notebook provided and save it as `cifar_model.h5`.
3. Install dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
